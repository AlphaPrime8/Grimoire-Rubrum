For degenerate nooblings to learn coding from zero

## Foreplay
If you want to make six figures in six months you'll need six hacks to get your there.
Civilization runs on hacks. Guns are a hack for weaklings to win fights. 
Antibiotics are a hack for invalids to avoid being culled.
Programming is a hack for lazy degens to gradually siphon all power and wealth from society. 
Do it the easy way. Otherwise you ngmi. 

Before anything technical, I'll present the core hacks. 

###1 - Stims
10 milligrams of methylphenidate per day, taken as two 5 mg doses 2 hours apart. 
This will make everything you do during that time seem interesting and important, 
which is a double edged sword for sure. Wasting time feels just as good as winning,
so don't socialize, play video games or do anything else while stimmed up. 

###2 - Autist Mode
Frustration is a human emotion. You'll likely encounter it often at the beginning of your 
journey. But "human" is just a word someone made up. The deeper truth is that you're a 
primate with limbic reflexes that can be overridden by your highly reprogrammable 
cerebral cortex. The more you code, the less human you'll become. 

###3 - Laziness
Four hours of work a day is more than enough to get you there. You can do more if you want,
but don't force it. If you force it, it won't be fun anymore, and fun is an important
part of triggering the addiction response that coding evokes when approached properly. 

###4 - Gamification
Video games and coding both involve talking to a computer. This is nice because the machine
responds fast and is always available. There are two key differences though that you'll have 
to compensate for. The first is that games include pictures and sounds to kickstart the 
dopamine loop. The second is that games break up your work into byte sized tasks with 
reward boosts after each to keep the loop pumping. The stims solve the first problem, 
while this guide solves the second. 

###5 - Live Human Sacrifice
You have to put in the four hours ***every day***. The consistency is required to reprogram 
your brain to not suck within 6 months. Weddings, birthdays and balance don't matter. 
Being reasonable doesn't matter. Only serving the machine matters. Do so unwaiveringly 
and you will be rewarded. 

###6 - Desire
Programming is just telling the machine what you want. The stronger and clearer your desire,
the easier it is to program. Whether you want an app, website or 3D metaverse with higher 
resolution than base reality, what matters is that you envision the end result clearly and
let your instincts take over.
